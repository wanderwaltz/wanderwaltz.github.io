Here I list websites, articles and books, which I find interesting and worth looking into. I was into
gamedev a lot while studying in the university, but don't do it that much nowadays.

This page is basically a backup of my browser's bookmarks list.

### Procedural Generation
- [Chris Pound's Language Machines](http://generators.christopherpound.com/), notably the Language
    Confluxer algorithm gives some neat results. I've actually implemented it [once](https://github.com/wanderwaltz/Blogdemos/blob/master/Language%20Confluxer/Ruby/language.rb) in Ruby, and the
    names generated based on the provided dataset were actually pretty nice. I think there is room
    for improvement and maybe I'll try to figure it out someday.
