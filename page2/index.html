    <p>I’ve stumbled upon an interesting looking <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/">blog</a> today. It has not been
updated for a long time now, but the articles posted there seem to be a pretty good read nevertheless.
I recon I should add this one to the <a href="links">links</a> page.</p>

    Artificial Inheritance

    <p><a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sid_burn/2014/03/inheritance-is-bad-code-reuse-part-1.html">They</a> <a href="http://blog.berniesumption.com/software/inheritance-is-evil-and-must-be-destroyed/">say</a> <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2010/01/15/inheritance-is-inherently-evil/">inheritance</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11056943/deep-class-inheritance-hierarchy-bad-idea">is</a> <a href="http://codingdelight.com/2014/01/16/favor-composition-over-inheritance-part-1/">bad</a>. Yes, there really are 5 different links in the previous sentence.</p>

<p>The links I’ve provided may not be the most trustworthy sources on the subject (as the matter of fact, I’ve entered ‘inheritance is bad’ in the Google prompt and used the top results just to provide a couple of examples). Jokes aside, there is a lot of info out there about the reasons to prefer composition over inheritance in most cases.</p>

<p>As with all of such statements you don’t blindly follow the rule. Inheritance is a tool, and as a software engineer you should know when and where to use your tools.</p>

<p>I’m using composition for building complex objects a lot these days. One of the patterns I’ve been using lately is adding Objective-C protocol conformance to specific objects (i.e. not classes, but individual instances) with the help of wrapper (or decorator) objects. To simplify the interaction with these wrappers I’m using the message forwarding mechanism, which allows me treating the wrapper object in the same way as the original object, but with the benefits of the added protocol.</p>

<p>Now starting with that in mind I’ve come up with an interesting little runtime construct, which utilizes composition and message forwarding to implement multiple inheritance-like behavior on instance level.</p>

    Once upon an App
  </a>

    <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>I was making this one app for a long time already. An app for a single user. Not really a promising venture, one might say. But this is personal. It’s an app for my father which helps him do his job and which he asked me to make for him when I was still going to school.</p>

<p>The app is actually pretty simple. It’s an implementation of a customized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory">Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory</a>) test (MMPI for shortness) which involves the user answering 500+ yes/no questions and a lot of tedious but otherwise simple math to calculate the results.</p>

<p>Before the app, father was calculating these results manually, which required comparing the answers list with a bunch of template tables, calculate means, standard deviations and all that statistical stuff, which is rather simple in formulae, but is tedious to compute by hand. I was aiming to be a programmer from my early days and it’s no surprise that my father asked me to make this app for him.</p>

<p>Well, I’ve made it. Two times from scratch already. And I think I’m going for the third.</p>

    <p>…suddenly opens vi to update a commit message and you don’t really know how to save the file and exit the goddamn editor.</p>

<p>No, really, I should probably learn me some vi because it is kind of ridiculous to go to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-to-exit-the-vim-editor">Stack Overflow</a> each time that happens in search for the magical keystroke. Another question is why my GUI git <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview">client of choice</a> does not handle this situation and does not allow entering the commit message in the user interface anyway.</p>

    <p>They say Objective-C is dead. A new king named Swift is rising and Objective-C days are counted. Well that’s probably true. It may be not completely true right now, but one day it will be. I surely need to familiarize myself with Swift a little bit more so I will know what I’m doing already when there would be no choice to write in it.</p>

<p>What’s bothering me still is that Swift is Apple-specific in the same way that Objective-C has always been. Learning Swift more, getting used to it will bind you tighter to the Apple platform (it does not matter, Mac OS or iOS). You still will have almost no experience on any other platforms or technologies.</p>
