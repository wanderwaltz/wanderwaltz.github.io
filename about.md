Hi, my name is Egor, I've been writing apps for iOS since 2009 and this is yet another tech blog related to various coding stuff I encounter in my everyday life.

I like creative coding which sometimes results in things which are better kept out of production but still worth pondering about. If you're looking for something like that, you've come to the right place.
