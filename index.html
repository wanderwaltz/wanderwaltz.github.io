    <p>I’ve <a href="/2016/03/27/web-design-with-a-coding-mentality/">mentioned</a> before that this blog
is a custom deployed one. While GitHub Pages support some of the Jekyll plugins, I’d like to have
more flexibility and freedom to use any other plugins, some of which I’ve made myself. As stated in
the GitHub Pages
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-jekyll-plugins-to-a-github-pages-site/">documentation</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other plugins are not supported, so the only way to incorporate them in your site is to generate
your site locally and then push your site’s static files to your GitHub Pages site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is exactly what I’m doing here. I think it may be useful for someone if I share my setup
of this blog’s development and deployment process.</p>

    Web Design with a Coding Mentality

    <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2016</span>

    <p>Recently I’ve come to a realization that I like coding better than writing. Consider this blog for
example. I’ve been tinkering with it for a couple of days now: changing the theme, moving CSS styles
around, optimizing usage of templates etc. - all that instead of actually writing some content,
which someone could actually read.</p>

<p>It is a funny thought - as a programmer, I value the internal structure, the beauty of the source
files more than the actual product, which will be used by the consumer.</p>

<p>Maybe this comes from the fact that I’m not really a good writer, but there is one more thing that
makes me do all this: I see this blog as a piece of software, with all the usual concerns such as
maintainability, extendibility etc.</p>

<p>They say that if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Programming is my hammer
and I’d like to share an example of a practical problem, which ended up not being a nail after all.</p>

    Safe NSArray literals
  </a>

</h1>


    <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2016</span>

    <p>While Swift is a new panacea an a go-to solution for all things programming, we still have to
maintain our years’-old Objective-C codebases. And that comes with a bag of old problems, which
every Objective-C programmer has encountered once in their life.</p>

<p>Consider an <code>NSArray</code>. Capable of containing any object type, it does not handle <code>nil</code>
all that well. Constructing an <code>NSArray</code> of objects using an array literal like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span class="bp">NSArray</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="l">@[</span><span class="n">object1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">object2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">object3</span><span class="l">]</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>is concise and convenient, but it comes with a cost. If any of the object references is actually
<code>nil</code>, we’ll have a crash in our hands. We don’t really want this to happen, right?</p>

    <p>I’ve already talked about my <a href="/2015/04/11/swift-wrappers-for-c-libraries/">quest</a> to learn me some Swift. Having implemented basic Swift wrappers for Squirrel tables and arrays, the time has come to move on to the fun stuff: binding functions.</p>

<p>Squirrel allows binding native functions having the <code>SQFUNCTION</code> signature which is as following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="nf">SQInteger</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">SQFUNCTION</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="n">HSQUIRRELVM</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Working with C function pointers in Swift? Oh boy, this gonna be good!</p>

    Writing Swift wrappers for C libraries
  </a>

</h1>


    <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>I’ve been kind of bashing Swift recently because of the current buggy state of the tools (SourceKit service and Swift compiler crashes are the most notable offenders). But I have to admit that as a language Swift has become much more usable then it was the last time I’ve touched it. I still encounter weird seemingly unrelated compilation error messages but (thanks to Stack Overflow and all the people who already encountered something similar) I usually can decipher the errors and either fix them or mourn for things that cannot be fixed.</p>

<p>Swift interaction with C code was actually a pleasant surprise for me. I’ve decided to practice Swift a bit by creating a wrapper/bindings library for <a href="http://squirrel-lang.org/">Squirrel</a> language. Squirrel is written in C++, but has C API so it should be simple to import it and use in Swift code. I’ve never actually thought it would be that easy.</p>
